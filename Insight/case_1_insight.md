# Case 1 — Student Engagement Analysis

## 🧠 Objective
Evaluate student engagement levels based on total activity minutes
within the last 30 days.

The purpose of this analysis is to identify highly engaged students
and distinguish them from low-activity or inactive users.

---

## 📊 Analysis Logic
1. Filter activity data to the **last 30 days**
2. Aggregate total activity minutes per student
3. Classify students into engagement levels using business rules:
   - Very Active
   - Active
   - Inactive

---

## 📈 Key Metrics
- **Total Activity Minutes (30 days)**
- **Engagement Status** (Very Active / Active / Inactive)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1️⃣ Engagement Is Highly Skewed
A small group of students accumulates significantly more activity minutes
compared to the majority.

**Interpretation:**  
Engagement follows a typical long-tail pattern where a few power users
drive most of the activity.

---

### 2️⃣ Majority of Students Fall Into Low Engagement
Most students are classified as **Inactive** or just **Active**,
with relatively low total activity minutes.

**Interpretation:**  
This suggests that many students register but do not fully engage
with the learning platform.

---

### 3️⃣ Clear Segmentation Enables Targeted Action
The engagement classification creates clear, actionable segments.

**Interpretation:**  
- Highly active students can be targeted for advanced programs or rewards  
- Inactive students can be re-engaged through reminders or onboarding improvements

---

## 💡 Business Implications
- Focus retention efforts on **early-stage engagement**
- Introduce activity-based nudges for low-engagement students
- Use engagement status as a core KPI for learning effectiveness

---

## ✅ Summary
Student engagement is unevenly distributed.
While a small group shows strong activity,
most students require better engagement strategies to remain active.
