# Case 2 — Course Engagement Funnel Analysis

## 🧠 Objective
Analyze the student engagement funnel per course,
from enrollment to consistent activity.

This case focuses on identifying where students drop off
after enrolling in a course.

---

## 📊 Analysis Logic
1. Count total enrolled students per course
2. Identify students with at least one recorded activity
3. Identify consistent students (≥ 3 active days)
4. Detect drop-off students with no activity at all
5. Build funnel metrics using conditional aggregation

---

## 📈 Key Metrics
- **Total Enrolled Students**
- **Active Students (≥ 1 activity)**
- **Consistent Students (≥ 3 active days)**
- **Drop-off Students (0 activity)**

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1️⃣ Significant Drop-Off After Enrollment
A noticeable portion of enrolled students never record any activity.

**Interpretation:**  
Enrollment alone does not guarantee engagement.
There is friction between signing up and starting the course.

---

### 2️⃣ Large Gap Between Active and Consistent Students
While some students try the course,
only a smaller subset becomes consistently active.

**Interpretation:**  
Initial interest exists, but sustained engagement is harder to achieve.

---

### 3️⃣ Funnel Pattern Is Similar Across Courses
Most courses show a similar drop-off pattern
from enrollment → active → consistent.

**Interpretation:**  
Retention challenges are likely systemic
rather than limited to specific courses.

---

## 💡 Business Implications
- Improve onboarding immediately after enrollment
- Add early checkpoints (Day 1–3) to encourage first activity
- Monitor funnel metrics to detect underperforming courses
- Use consistent students as indicators of course quality

---

## ✅ Summary
Course engagement decreases at each funnel stage.
The main opportunity lies in converting enrolled students
into active and consistently engaged learners.
